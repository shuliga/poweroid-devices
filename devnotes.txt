### ATmega1284P

Clock Frequency
The ATmega1284P has two internal oscillators clocked at 8MHz and at 128kHz that allow it to be operated without any external clock source or crystal.
By default the fuses are configured to use the internal 8MHz oscillator, but the CKDIV8 fuse is set, so that the clock is divided down to 1MHz.
By disabling the CKDIV8 fuse the clock will operate at 8MHz. This is highly encouraged, and can be done with:

avrdude -c ardiuino -p m1284p -B 32 -U lfuse:w:0xc2:m

The -B 32 might be needed for some programmers to successfully communicate with ATmegas clocked at less than 2MHz.
It will no longer be needed after disabling CKDIV8.
